# 1. Introduction
The existing surveys related to the computer vision in livestock are insufficient regarding in-depth coverage, classification, and comparison of each dataset and its application in PLF. The main contribution of this survey is to identify, classify, and comprehensive discussion of public livestock datasets. Moreover, the data acquisition techniques, application scenarios, and baseline evaluations of the selected datasets are highlighted.
